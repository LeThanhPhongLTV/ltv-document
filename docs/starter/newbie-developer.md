<p style="text-indent: 0.25rem;"> This is a document about knowing and learning beginner technical requirements. But it's also more. It will help you speed up the learning process and observe team workflow way faster 🚀. 
 </br> Each section is independent; you don't need to read it in order, so if there is a particular section you are interested in, feel free to skip to it. Let's get started! 🌱</p>

## Technical Knowledgement <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/WUlplcMpOCEmTGBtBW/giphy.gif" width="30"> <a name="heading1"></a>
The first thing I want to discuss 💬 are some technical problems when I was a beginner joining a software development team. I found it difficult to know where I need to start and what need to do 📝. So here are some common problems I have faced to let you guys know what to focus on and how to start working as a team member in an LTV development team.
### Github <img src="../../assets/images/github.svg" width="18"><a name="heading1.1"></a>
Yes! Hand down, Github is the most used service of any IT organization including LTV and I know that you already have some experience using Git but working as a team is a whole different thing. 
</br> So knowing how to use it as a team is a crucial skill you need to know and work on. Here are some step by step how to use Github and learn Github workflow in LTV that you need to check out. 

### Jira Software <img src="https://fd-assets.prod.atl-paas.net/image/logos/contrib/jira-software/icons/white.svg" width="18"><a name="heading1.2"></a>
Jira is a software application used for <b>issue tracking and project management</b>being operated and used in the company.

### Slack <img src="../../assets/images/slack.svg" width="20"><a name="heading1.3"></a>
Slack is a messaging program designed specifically for the office, but has also been adopted for personal use. LTV are using it for member communication when _working from home_.
